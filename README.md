# Slime-Simulation

This project was to simulate the behaviour of slime molds or more specifically, the species physarum polycephalum.

This project takes inspiration from this video by Sebastian Lague: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-iSQQgOd1A

The idea is that using simple instructions for each agent, complex behaviours can be simulated and without any global goals or pattern cues, organic patterns are spontaneously formed.

The main code can be found in the slime.py file. The program creates gifs using the Pillow library as means of obtaining smooth visual simulations via post processing even when running on low hardware specs. 

Some images are included of the various results obtained by running and modifying various parameters such as sensor distance, sensor angle, and agent turn angle.
